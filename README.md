# amplitude-apd-analysis
Code available to public for Nature Communications paper
This is a matlab code for functions and following commands used for APD and Amplitude analysis from action potentials traces.
Note that they cannot be used only by copying them to matlab and compiling them, rather they need to be adjusted and added to a running suitable code which imports your relevant file for analysis to a matlab vector.
Additional comments are present in the attached files to help better understand the code in order to facilitate implementation.
